## 1. Description
Shine is the 21st century solution to the 1st century problem of dirty shoes.  Shoe Shiners used to be commonplace in America’s cities but while times have changed and technology has advanced the tools available for professional shoe care have been left in the past.  Shine creates a marketplace where users can request shoe cleaning services and local merchants can bid, fulfill, arrange contactless pickup/delivery and get paid for those jobs all in one place without having to search through phone books or endless webpages trying to find the right merchant with the right services.  Instead, with Shine you get to say what services you need and merchants will compete for your business.  As a merchant Shine is also fantastic.  Want to set your own hours or work without a physical location?  All of this is possible with Shine.
